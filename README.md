## NOTE: 
Project "temporarily" discontinued as the original authors have lost interest in the game/project however continued development from fellow developers is not to be discouraged, if you wish so. An improved version of this bot (improved fork) is and can be found [here](https://github.com/j-c-m/Slither.io-bot) but both have been discontinued.

One of the main reasons for discontinuation, is to embark on a new journey working on other areas in programming and using other languages as there is always something new to learn.

**New active project will be linked soon and ANYBODY is welcome to collaborate with us! Await new updates!**
# Slither.io bot
Just for fun and AI. Written in Javascript, this is a project which the aim is to make a computer play against humans inside a human-driven game, which is in this case Slither.io. The goal is simple - try and make the snake live and get as long as possible.
